## 🎯 Business Objective
The goal was to replace an outdated web presence with a modern platform that builds trust and simplifies the lead generation process. By implementing a mobile-first design and optimizing for local SEO, the site serves as a 24/7 automated sales tool for the business.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with **Next.js 14/15** and **TypeScript** for a robust, type-safe development environment.
- **Dynamic UI Components:** Leveraged **Shadcn/UI** and **Lucide React** to build a consistent, accessible, and professional interface.
- **Performance Optimized:** - Server-side rendering (SSR) for instant perceived load times.
  - Optimized image delivery using the Next.js Image component.
  - Zero-layout shift (CLS) for a smooth user experience.
- **Conversion-Driven UX:** Integrated clear CTA (Call to Action) sections and a streamlined contact flow.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy: "Zero-Defect Frontend"
Drawing from 7 years of experience at **Benteler Group** in a zero-defect industrial environment, I applied the same methodical approach to this codebase:
1. **Type Safety:** Used TypeScript interfaces throughout to catch errors at compile-time, ensuring a stable production environment.
2. **Component Modularity:** Followed atomic design principles to ensure components are reusable and easy to maintain.
3. **Clean Code:** Prioritized readability and consistent naming conventions to facilitate future scalability.
